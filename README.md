## Overview
This project proposes the development of a client tool that utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to categorize photos based on user-defined natural language prompts. Users can describe their desired categories using simple descriptions, and the tool will automatically organize their photo library accordingly.

## Problem Statement
Managing large photo libraries is often cumbersome, with users spending significant time manually organizing their images into folders or albums. Existing solutions rely heavily on basic metadata (e.g., timestamps, locations) or simple image recognition. However, there is a need for a more flexible and intuitive approach that allows users to define custom categories based on their specific needs.
